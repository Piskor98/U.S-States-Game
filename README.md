# U.S States Game
The project was created using code written in Python using the turtle graphics module and pandas.


U.S States Game is a game to guess and learn names of the states in the United States. 
The highest score is saved in a text file and displayed on the board each time the game starts,
and each time the game ends, the file containing the names of the states that the user did not know or did not guess is overwritten,
allowing him to complete his knowledge.

If you are interested in my idea, check also the version for learning european country names available on my github. (Europe's countrys)
